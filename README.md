## ‚ö° **Why Signum Miner?**

Signum is the world's first truly sustainable blockchain ‚Äî and the Signum Miner is your gateway to mining it efficiently and eco-consciously. Whether you're using modern AVX512-capable CPUs, an ARM board, or legacy hardware, the Signum Miner is optimized to deliver fast results with minimal energy.

> Join the green revolution of decentralized computing ‚Äî mine with purpose. Mine with Signum.

## üì¶ **Installation**

### üñ•Ô∏è Precompiled Binaries

‚û°Ô∏è [Go to Releases](https://github.com/signum-network/signum-miner/releases)

Download the binary matching your system:

For Linux distributions:
- `signum-miner-avx` 
- `signum-miner-avx2`
- `signum-miner-avx512f` (modern CPUs)
- `signum-miner-sse2` (legacy CPUs)
- ` signum-miner-aarch64-neon` (ARM)

For Windows distributions one of the `.exe` versions:
- `signum-miner-avx` 
- `signum-miner-avx2`
- `signum-miner-avx512f` (modern CPUs)
- `signum-miner-sse2` (legacy CPUs)

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Running the binaries**

### Config

The miner needs a **config.yaml** file.</br>
Please download from the corresponding release. Direct I/O will be
automatically disabled for plot directories residing on USB drives.

`io_buffer_size` lets you tune how much data is read from disk per task. The
default of 4&nbsp;MiB works well for most drives but you may lower it for slow
USB devices.

`capacity_check_interval` defines how often the miner rescans the plot
directories to update its total capacity. The default of 6&nbsp;hours is a good
balance for most setups.

### Running
Be sure to have the config file on the same folder of your binary.</br>

For windows, double click on the executable file.</br>
If it refuses to run, start the executable from a command prompt to check for error messages.</br>
For Linux run it with the folliwing command:</br>
```shell
./signum-miner
```

### GUI helper

For an optional graphical interface, run `miner_ui.py` with Python 3. The UI now
uses the [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)
framework to provide a modern dark theme with blue accents. Four tabs are
available: **Home**, a raw YAML editor (**Config**), an **Options** tab for
editing fields and a **Logs** tab to monitor output. Install the required
packages first:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can then edit `config.yaml`, start or stop the miner and monitor its log
output in a more user friendly window.

```bash
python3 miner_ui.py
```

The CustomTkinter based UI works on Linux, macOS and Windows as long as Python 3
is available and the `signum-miner` binary is in the same directory.
Make sure the compiled miner binary is named **exactly** `signum-miner`,
otherwise the UI will fail to launch it.

## üíª Build from Source
 - First you need to install a Rust stable toolchain, check https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
 - Binaries are in **target/debug** or **target/release** depending on optimization.

```bash
# Install Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/signum-network/signum-miner
cd signum-miner
# Or run the automated setup which installs requirements and builds
python3 setup.py


# decide on features to run/build:
simd: support for SSE2, AVX, AVX2 and AVX512F (x86_cpu)
neon: support for Arm NEON (arm_cpu)
async_io: enable async disk reads (tokio) and switch internal locks to
Tokio's asynchronous `Mutex`, so calls to `.lock()` must be awaited


# Build with desired features (choose one!)
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features simd_avx

# Enable asynchronous disk I/O
cargo build --release --features async_io

# Default Build with avx2 features 
cargo build --release 
```
